## Let's choose baby name

```
Once Java Programmer was expecting to have baby, actually 2 babies.
He wrote a program to choose names for his newborns.
Unexpectedly triplets were born and the got the names:
Adam, Frank and... ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
```

This is simple program (or rather group of programs) is solving similar problem.
We are going to draw name for a newborn. Data source is based on real data [https://dane.gov.pl/dataset/219,imiona-nadawane-dzieciom-w-polsce](https://dane.gov.pl/dataset/219,imiona-nadawane-dzieciom-w-polsce)
